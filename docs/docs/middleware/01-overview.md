# Overview

In JetProxy, middleware is a powerful tool used to modify or adjust requests before they are forwarded to your services, or to modify responses before they are sent back to the clients.

JetProxy offers several types of middleware that can be used to customize the behavior of your requests. For example, some middleware can handle authentication, or even manage caching behavior. Middleware provides a way to add additional layers of control and customization to ensure that requests and responses meet your application's needs.

Multiple middleware that use the same protocol can be combined into a chain, allowing for flexible and powerful configurations to handle a wide variety of scenarios.
