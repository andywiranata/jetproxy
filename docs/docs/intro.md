# JetProxy

**JetProxy** is a lightweight, high-performance HTTP proxy library built with Jetty. It is designed for developers seeking a flexible and efficient solution for routing, caching, and managing HTTP requests.

## Getting Started

In today’s fast-paced microservices architecture, an efficient and automated API gateway is crucial. Managing connections between microservices and external users can be challenging, especially in dynamic environments where services are frequently added, removed, updated, or scaled.

Traditional reverse proxies require manual configuration for each route, making them less practical for modern setups. JetProxy introduces a modern API reverse proxy designed to automate routing and dynamically direct traffic to your microservices with minimal effort.

By automatically discovering services and adjusting routes, JetProxy simplifies management, enhances scalability, and reduces operational overhead, allowing you to focus on developing your services instead of maintaining complex routing configurations.

With built-in support for dynamic routing, automatic load balancing, and customizable middleware, JetProxy is ideal for developers seeking a modern, efficient proxy solution. Its seamless integration into microservices architectures allows for automated routing, service scaling, and reduced operational complexity—all without the need for constant manual updates.

Additionally, JetProxy ensures your API is secure with role-based access control. By integrating role authorization and basic authentication, you can manage access to sensitive routes easily, allowing only authorized users with specific roles to interact with your services. This adds a robust layer of security, protecting your API from unauthorized access while maintaining flexibility and ease of configuration.
